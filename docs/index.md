## Quick Start

1.  **Fork** the repository as `USERNAME.github.io`
2.  **Enable** GitHub Actions workflow
3.  **Deploy** via GitHub Pages (source: `gh-pages` branch)

That's it! Your repository gallery will be live and updating automatically. See the [full guide](/getting-started) for a more in-depth explanation.

## Why ProjectDepot Gallery?

-   **Set & Forget**: Once set up, it runs itself.
-   **Customizable**: Full control over which repositories to display.
-   **Fast**: Built with modern web technologies for optimal performance.
-   **Free**: Hosted on GitHub Pages with no additional costs.

## Motivation

Creating and maintaining a portfolio website can be a time-consuming task -- one that I personally push to the back burner often. I built PD Gallery to solve that problem by using a GitHub profile to populate the site.
