> **Your GitHub Portfolio, On Autopilot.**

![SrcGallery preview](/readme-images/srcgallery-preview.png)

A zero-maintenance landing page that updates itself. Fork this repo, and it will automatically showcase your projects using GitHub Actions.

## Elevator Pitch

Portfolios are just kind of a pain to make and maintain.

On the other hand, it's easy to make a GitHub account and to build up a collection of projects over time.

So why not use that GitHub profile to populate your portfolio? That's what this project does.

If you've already made projects on GitHub, I think that's all you should need in order to have a portfolio.
