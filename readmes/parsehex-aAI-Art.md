# aAI Art

> alternative AI Art

This is an app that explores using AI to create procedural graphics, in contrast to using traditional image models. Instead of generating images directly, we prompt an LLM to return JSON instructions that define sprites, which are then rendered using [Konva](https://konvajs.org/). You can now also **Edit** sprites created in this app.

Here are some examples of sprites created by LLMs:
