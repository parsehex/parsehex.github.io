# DataKit

This is a web app meant for viewing and managing arbitrary data in the browser (i.e. data isn't sent anywhere for processing). Data is stored using IndexedDB and the app is reactive across multiple tabs -- add a file in one tab and it'll appear within the app on other tabs.

Currently the following data/file types can be viewed:

- **Spreadsheets** display in a table
- **Images** are rendered on the page
- **Text** is also displayed on the page

Try the app at <https://parsehex.github.io/datakit/>
