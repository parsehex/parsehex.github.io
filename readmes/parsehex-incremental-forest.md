# Incremental Forest

This is an attempt to make an incremental game where you play as a character that is controlled with W/A/S/D keys. There's a simple game loop but you can hire NPC workers to help, which move around the map on their own.

This project was originally started from the [phaser-es6-webpack](https://github.com/lean/phaser-es6-webpack) boilerplate project by [lean](https://github.com/lean). Besides that, most of the project was written from scratch.

## New: **Rocks**

The default map now comes with 4 boulders which can be chopped using the Pick Axe, giving you Rocks that you can sell.
